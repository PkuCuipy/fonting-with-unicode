### Understanding Unicode "Fonts"
#### Traditional Fonts
Traditionally, fonts are applied to text using stylesheets or formatting options. This method changes the appearance of the text without altering the underlying characters. For example, the letter "A" can be displayed in different fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, or Noto Sans, but it remains the same character "A".

#### Unicode "Fonts"
Unicode "fonts", however, use different Unicode characters to represent various stylistic variations. Instead of changing the appearance of the same underlying character, these characters themselves are replaced with other Unicode characters that have different appearances. For instance, "A" can become "𝐀" (bold serif), where "A" and "𝐀" are technically different characters.

Styled text created with Unicode fonts maintains its appearance across different platforms and devices, provided that the Unicode characters are supported. There is no need for font files or CSS, and most fonts will not affect the appearance of these Unicode characters. Therefore, users can copy and paste the styled text anywhere without concerns about its visual consistency. For example, the character "𝐀" (bold serif) will look the same regardless of whether the surrounding text is in Arial, Times New Roman, or Noto Sans.

#### Limitations
However, not all characters have stylized Unicode equivalents, limiting the range of available styles compared to traditional fonts. Additionally, overuse of stylized text can affect readability and accessibility, so it is best used sparingly for headings, titles, or creative purposes. Moreover, the appearance of Unicode characters may vary across different systems and platforms.
